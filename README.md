# POS Tagging for Indian Languages using CRF

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** for Indian languages using the **Conditional Random Field (CRF)** algorithm. POS tagging is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding grammatical category, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

Indian languages, being morphologically rich and diverse, present unique challenges in NLP. This project aims to develop an accurate POS tagger that can handle these challenges effectively using a statistical model like CRF.
